# Code for: "interactive demo" from Trevor.io landing page

We built an interactive demo walk-through of our platform for our landing page (click image below to [see it in action](https://trevor.io#demo)).

Feel free to fork this repo if you want to **build your own** interactive demo.

[![screenshot trevor demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tagspace/trevor-demo/master/img/screenshot-trevor-demo.png)](https://trevor.io#demo)

A blogpost explaining how we built it is available [here](https://app.trevor.io/public/blog/demo).

To run this demo on your own machine, clone/download this repo and run:

./start-on-mac.sh
